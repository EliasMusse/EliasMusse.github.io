    The bare minimum to playing Red Mage is simply building your Mana to 80 | 80 and then unleashing your melee combo with a powerful finisher. The core rotation of the job has not changed very much since its inception in Stormblood, and if you are already familiar with the fundamentals of the job you may wish to focus on the 5.x changes and additions to the job section of the guide.

        At its base, Red Mage has a fairly straightforward rotation, making it a very attractive pick for new players. However, Red Mage has a surprising amount of hidden depth when it comes to optimisation and an awful lot of thought is involved when trying to play at a high level. This guide will show that there is definitely much more to optimising Red Mage than your basic ABCs.

<div class="rdmplus">
<ul> Strengths

    <li>Very intuitive & beginner friendly rotation.</li>
    <li>Powerful prog tools in the form of Verraise & Vercure that can salvage runs.</li>
    <li>Embolden is a strong raid buff in a physical based comp.</li>
    <li>
        Solid general mobility with dualcast windows.</li>
        
  </ul> 
  </div> 
  <div class="rdmminus">
      <ul> Weaknesses
          <li>Currently has the lowest damage output out of all casters. 5.2 saw buffs to bring it up closer to the others.</li>
          <li>Due to party Embolden only buffing physical damage, Red Mage does not synergize well with fellow casters despite double caster comp being a solid choice.</li>
          <li>Limited burst movement options.</li>

      </ul>
